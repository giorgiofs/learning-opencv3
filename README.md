# learning-opencv3

Examples and exercises from the book "Learning OpenCV 3" by Adrian Kaeler and Gary Bradski.

Still a work in progress. All the code runs on Debian 8.6, gcc version 4.9.2.

This is not going to be a comprehensive resource, since I will work on examples and exercises according to need and not in a systematic way. Who knows what will happen long-term, though.

## naming convention

* `ex_xxyy.cpp` is example yy from chapter xx.
* `xc_xxyy.cpp` is exercise yy from chapter xx.
